# Formula 1 Data Engineering & ML Project

## 🚀 About the Project

An end-to-end data engineering pipeline for Formula 1 datasets, covering extraction, loading, transformation, and setting the foundation for machine learning modeling — along with dashboard creation using Power BI — built entirely using open-source tools and technologies.

This project demonstrates practical skills in building a scalable and maintainable data platform from scratch using free and self-hosted resources.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** — for data extraction and loading.
- **PostgreSQL** — as the relational database (local).
- **DBT (Core)** — for building the staging layer transformations.
- *(Upcoming: Machine Learning tools like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)*
- *(Upcoming: Power BI for data visualization.)*

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Extract raw Formula 1 datasets from Kaggle.
- Load datasets into a local PostgreSQL database under a `raw` schema.
- Transform raw tables into clean staging models using DBT.
- Placeholder for:
  - Building star-schema data marts.
  - Training machine learning models on engineered data.
  - Visualizing insights using Power BI dashboards.
